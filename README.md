# Assignment 1: Environment Setup
Students should leave this assignment with their environment configured to use the tools described in the README


## Objective
The purpose of this assignment is to setup student's computer such that they can easily participate in learning and using the technical skills introduced throughout the class with minimal extra setup.


## Outline
0. Creating your own copy of this repository by clicking [this](https://classroom.github.com/a/lMFUaKlm) link (create an account if you don't have one yet)
1. (Optional) creating a virtual machine with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (necessary for most Windows users)
2. Opening a terminal

## Instructions

### Step 0: Clone this repository
The classroom link for this class can be found at: [https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/42415240-reprocourse](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/42415240-reprocourse). You should bookmark this page, as it is where all assignments will be made available. To clone this repository you need to click the assignment link and sign into Github. If you don't have an account on Github yet, create one! We'll explain in more detail what this means soon, for now just accept that it is a tool worth using, and we'll teach you how :wink:.

### Step 1: Setup a virtual machine
The purpose of this step is to ensure we have access to an environment where we can run a "terminal." A terminal, if you're unfamiliar, is simply a console that allows you to enter commands that are interpretted by your computer in a specific way.

If you are using a Linux distribution (i.e. Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, etc.) or Mac OSx, you can skip this step. Also, if you are running a version of Windows 10 that allows you to run an Ubuntu subshell, you may also be able to skip this step.

[Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is a great tool which can help. I won't recreate their "getting started," but let's follow it :smile:. I recommend creating a machine with Ubuntu 16.04 on it.

### Step 2: Open a terminal

Based on your operating system (either of your host OS or virtual machine, if you're using one), Google, "how to open terminal <operating system here>".
